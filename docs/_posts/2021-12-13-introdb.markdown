For this post, I'm going to write about my project writing a database,
I'm calling it introdb for now, from scratch. Like my other posts, this side
project is for learning purpose, so I'm limiting the scope quite a bit.
Before I start, I'm taking my hats off to Conrad Stack. It was his [post](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)
that inspired me to do my own take.

I want to start introdb very simply: an in-memory append-only database with
a fixed schema shown below.

| Column  | Type         |
|---------|--------------|
| id      | int          |
| item    | varchar(32)  |
| desc    | varchar(256) |

(Work in progress)
