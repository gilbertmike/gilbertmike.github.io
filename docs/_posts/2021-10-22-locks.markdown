I've used locks in my programming for a while now and I sort of understand how
they're implemented using atomic operations. However, I've never implemented
one myself. We're going to change that!

I picked up, more like got a digital copy, of Shavit and Herlihy's The Art of
Multiprocessor Programming. So let's implement some locks.

# Test-and-Set lock

This one's simple enough. You check a variable to know if the lock is up for
grab or not. If it is, feel free to take it. Just make sure the test-and-set
operation is atomic, hence the name.
